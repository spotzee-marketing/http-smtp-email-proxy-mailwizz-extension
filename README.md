**One Endpoint, Multiple Providers**
- Send via SMTP server (port 587/2525) or HTTP API endpoint
- Your emails route automatically across all configured providers
- Failed providers bypassed instantly with zero downtime

**Human-Like Sending**
- Configure rate limit ranges (e.g., "2-3 per hour", "20-25 per day")
- System randomizes sending rate every 5 minutes within your range
- Appears natural to email providers, improves deliverability

## Smart Routing & Groups

**Group Your Providers by Purpose**

Organize email accounts into custom groups (Marketing, Transactional, Customer Support, etc.) and route emails intelligently based on email headers.

**How It Works:**
- Create groups like "Marketing", "Transactional", "Notifications"
- Assign provider accounts to each group
- Add custom email header `X-Delivery-Route` with the group ID
- Emails automatically route through the designated group's providers

**Use Cases:**
- **Marketing Campaigns** - Route through dedicated marketing provider accounts
- **Transactional Emails** - Send receipts and notifications through high-priority transactional accounts
- **Customer Support** - Separate reply/support emails from bulk campaigns
- **Client Segregation** - Agencies can isolate client campaigns for better reputation management

This ensures marketing campaigns never impact transactional email deliverability, and you maintain separate sending reputations for different email types.
